# LPG Gas Leakage Detection and Mitigation System

## Overview

The LPG Gas Leakage Detection and Mitigation System is an advanced safety solution designed to protect homes from the dangers of LPG gas leaks. This system not only detects gas leaks but also takes immediate actions to prevent potential fires and alert the homeowner. The system features automatic gas valve closure, power shutdown, and real-time notification to ensure comprehensive safety.

## Features

1. **Gas Leak Detection**:
   - Equipped with highly sensitive gas sensors to detect LPG gas leaks accurately and promptly.
   
2. **Automatic Valve Closure**:
   - Instantly closes the main valve of the gas tank to prevent further leakage upon detection of gas.

3. **Power Shutdown**:
   - Automatically turns off the electricity in the house to eliminate potential ignition sources and reduce fire risk.

4. **Real-Time Notification**:
   - Sends an immediate alert message to the homeowner's mobile device to inform them of the gas leak incident.

## Components

- **Gas Sensors**: High-precision sensors that detect LPG gas concentrations in the air.
- **Control Unit**: The brain of the system, which processes sensor data and triggers safety actions.
- **Automatic Valve Actuator**: Mechanism that closes the gas valve upon receiving a signal from the control unit.
- **Power Cut-Off Relay**: Device that disconnects the main power supply to the house when activated.
- **Communication Module**: Sends SMS or push notifications to the homeowner’s mobile device.

## Installation

1. **Sensor Placement**:
   - Install gas sensors near potential leak sources such as gas stoves, heaters, and the gas tank.

2. **Control Unit Setup**:
   - Position the control unit centrally within the home for optimal communication with sensors and actuators.

3. **Valve Actuator Installation**:
   - Attach the valve actuator to the main gas valve ensuring it can operate effectively to close the valve.

4. **Power Cut-Off Relay Installation**:
   - Integrate the relay with the home’s main power supply system for complete disconnection capability.

5. **Communication Module Configuration**:
   - Configure the communication module with the homeowner’s contact information for immediate alerts.

## Operation

1. **Detection**:
   - The system continuously monitors the air for LPG gas concentrations.
   
2. **Action**:
   - Upon detecting a gas leak, the control unit sends signals to:
     - Close the gas valve via the valve actuator.
     - Shut down the house’s electrical supply via the power cut-off relay.
   
3. **Notification**:
   - Simultaneously, the communication module sends a notification message to the homeowner’s mobile device, detailing the gas leak incident.

## Maintenance

- **Regular Testing**:
  - Periodically test the gas sensors and the entire system to ensure functionality.
  
- **Sensor Calibration**:
  - Calibrate gas sensors as per manufacturer recommendations to maintain accuracy.

- **System Updates**:
  - Keep the control unit firmware and communication module software up to date for optimal performance and security.

## Safety Precautions

- Ensure proper installation by a qualified technician.
- Do not tamper with or modify system components.
- Regularly inspect and maintain the system to prevent malfunctions.
